# [](#my-research)My Research

I currently work as a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at the [COGNITIVE ROBOTICS LAB](https://corolab.github.io/) in the Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester (United Kingdom).
Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Human-Robot Interaction at the [Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/robotics-neural-systems).
As a researcher, I have focused on Humanoid Robots; Artificial Intelligence; Cognitive Systems; Machine Learning Algorithms and Deep Learning; and Human-Robot Interaction.

I have a career spanning multiple fields and research topics, across national boundaries, with 10 years of experience with robotics research, from the Mechatronics Group at Universidad Simon Bolivar, the RoboticsLab at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems at University of Plymouth. I have also experience from short research stays in Spain (Centre for Automation and Robotics, CSIC), Switzerland (Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory, EPFL), and Italy (Italian Institute of Technology). I have taken part in a number of both, national and European projects implementing various systems and designing and executing different study scenarios and experiments, both in simulation and with real physical robots.

I have experience working on all levels of robotics, from the integration of servos, sensors and microcontrollers, the programing of control software and user interfaces, to the development of high level cognitive architectures and learning algorithms. I have worked on several real-world platforms, like the child-size humanoid iCub, the collaborative robot BAXTER, and the social robots Pepper and NAO; I have additional working experience with the climbing hexapod REST robot, the fujitsu humanoid robot HOAP-3, and the small RoboNova and Bioloid humanoid robots (for competitions).

My interest is in exploring topics related to Cognitive Systems, Human-Robot Interactions, Machine Learning and Neurorobotics. The goal of my research has been to employ machine learning algorithms to allow systems to understand information created around them and to generate knowledge and develop robots able to respond adaptively and appropriately to the combination of unexpected events and indeterminate consequences of the real world; I work to develop socially intelligent and interactive robots, capable of having natural interactions with humans. I want to applied DL for social robotics and learning of social behaviours and cues; enhancing ML through social human-robot interaction. I would be very interested in developing further such a research line in University of Plymouth. Designing a new generation of robots that can learn human behavioural skills with a view to interacting with us socially, intelligently and emotionally; and that can be deployed as companions for the elderly, therapist for special needs patients, tutors in our schools, and service robots in a near future.

##### Human-Robot Interactions in Social Robots for education and therapy.

##### Deep Learning for Social Intelligent Robots.

##### Cognitive and Neuro-Robotics.

##### Learning and Adapting Robot Skills.

##### Knowledge Representation.


##### Interactive Task Learning


##### Ethical Issues in Robotics.

I am also interested in the ethical issues of using robots and robot ethics.
I co-organize a workshop on [Social Robots in Therapy](https://sites.google.com/view/srec18/home) at the 13th, 14th and 15th ACM / IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2018);  with a focus on autonomy and ethical challenges. The workshop aims at understanding how increasing the autonomy of robots might affect therapies as well as the design and ethical challenges of health-care robots.

### [](#movecare)MoveCare

#### MoveCare: Multiple-actOrs Virtual Empathic CARgiver for the Elder

MoveCare integrates an existing robotic platform with a domotic system, smart objects, a virtual community and an activity center, to provide, through artificial intelligence, assistance, activities and transparent monitoring to the elder at home. MoveCare can be tailored to each elder thanks to a modular design. It is completely unobtrusive as MoveCare does not require the elder to wear any particular device. Angelo Cangelosi is Principal Investigator at Manchester.

### [](#dream)DREAM

#### DREAM: Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for children with AutisM spectrum disorders

Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for children with AutisM spectrum disorders (ref. FP7-ICT-600915). Integrated Project under the 7th framework programme of the European Union. 4.5 year project, start 1 February 2014. Total budget of 8.6M EUR, with 1.23M EUR for Plymouth. Tony Belpaeme is Principal Investigator at Plymouth. Other partners are Hogskolan I Skovde (Tom Ziemke, Project Coordinator), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Universitatea Babes Bolyai, University of Portsmouth, De Montfort University and Aldebaran Robotics.

### [](#l2tor)L2TOR

#### L2TOR: Second Language Tutoring using Social Robots

Second Language Tutoring using Social Robots (3.043M EUR total budget, 544,013 EUR to Plymouth University) project. H2020 project, coordinated by Tony Belpaeme. Other partners University of Tilburg, Bielefeld University, Utrecht University, Koc University, Aldebaran Robotics and QBMT. The L2TOR studies how robots can be used to tutor a second language to young children. L2TOR capitalises on research that shows how social robots have marked benefits over screen-based tutoring technologies.

### [](#babel)BABEL

#### EPSRC Project BABEL: Bio-Inspired Architecture for Brain Embodied Language​.

BAEL is a new EPSRC project on the computational neuroscience modelling of language and action learning in the humanoid robot iCub, and its implementation in the neuromorphic systems SpiNNAker. It integrates cognitive neuroscience, brain imaging, neuro-computational modelling, and neurorobotic experiments in advancing our understanding of the neuroscience mechanisms supporting language learning.​ ​This project will lead to the design of neuromorphic systems for cognitive and language processing suitable for a wide range of interactive system applications (e.g. autonomous service robots, smart devices, speech interfaces, intelligent transport vehicles).

This project was funded by EPSRC EP/J004561/1 and lasted from August 2012 to March 2017. [http://www.babel-project.org/](http://www.babel-project.org/)

### [](#robotcwe)Robot@CWE

#### European Specific Targeted Research Project ROBOT@CWE: Advanced robotic systems in future collaborative working environments.

The main objective of this project was to research and demonstrate integrative concepts of advanced robotic systems, to be seen as collaborative agents, in various environments working together with humans. We integrated collaborative robotic systems as active agents operated through various control paradigms within working environment clusters. ROBOT@CWE designed suitable architectures and technologies to achieve this goal. A major aspect of the project was human-centred design, especially the assessment of usability, social acceptance, user experience, and societal impact of humanoid robots.

This STREP project was funded by FP6-2005-IST-5 Collaborative Working Environments and lasted from November 2006 to October 2009. [https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/80174_en.html](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/80174_en.html)
