# [](#my-research)My Research


<!--
As a researcher, I have focused on Human-Robot Interaction, Machine Learning Algorithms and Cognitive Systems, taking part in a number of both, national and European projects.
I worked in the control of Humanoid Robots, principally with the [iCub humanoid robot](icub) and the fujitsu HOAP-3 robot platform. I also work in the development of Human-Robot Interfaces to interact with the robot and the implementation of Human-Robot Interaction and Computer Vision algorithms.

I am interested in topics of Human-Robot Interaction, Human-Robot Collaboration and Machine Learning Algorithms, Learning from Demonstration, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Systems and Data Analysis. -->


<!-- Durante la estancia se pudo aprender un sistema dinámico estable para controlar la posición y la orientación del efector final en una tarea de manipulación. Se implementaron tres controladores para probar el sistema, un controlador desacoplado de la posición y orientación, un controlador completamente acoplado, y finalmente un controlador parcialmente acoplado de la orientación respecto a la posición. Se estudiaron los efectos de reproducir trayectorias bajo estos tres controladores, así como el comportamiento bajo diferentes perturbaciones espacio‐temporales durante la trayectoria. Para validar el modelo se controlo un robot humanoide, HOAP‐3, con un brazo manipulador de 4 grados de libertad. Se enseñaron 4 tareas de manipulación al robot para demostrar la validez de los modelos y el controlador y se realizaron varias pruebas de la reproducción de la tarea con el robot humanoide HOAP‐3.  -->


##### Human-Robot Interactions in Social Robots for education and therapy.

##### Deep Learning for Social Robots.

##### Cognitive and Neuro-Robotics.


##### Dynamical Systems.


##### Knowledge.


##### Ethical Issues in Robotics.

I am also interested in the ethical issues of using robots and robot ethics.
I'm co-organizing a workshop at on [Social Robots in Therapy](https://sites.google.com/view/srec18/home) with a focus on autonomy and ethical challenges. The workshop aims at understanding how increasing the autonomy of robots might affect therapies as well as the design and ethical challenges of health-care robots.


## [](#projects)Research Projects

I have a career spanning multiple fields and research topics, across national boundaries. As a researcher, I have focused on Machine Learning Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Systems and Human-Robot Interaction, taking part in a number of both, national and European projects; implementing various systems and designing and executing different study scenarios and experiments, both in simulation and with real physical robots.

### [](#dream)DREAM

#### DREAM: Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for children with AutisM spectrum disorders

Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for children with AutisM spectrum disorders (ref. FP7-ICT-600915). Integrated Project under the 7th framework programme of the European Union. 4.5 year project, start 1 February 2014. Total budget of 8.6M EUR, with 1.23M EUR for Plymouth. Tony Belpaeme is Principal Investigator at Plymouth. Other partners are Hogskolan I Skovde (Tom Ziemke, Project Coordinator), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Universitatea Babes Bolyai, University of Portsmouth, De Montfort University and Aldebaran Robotics.

### [](#l2tor)L2TOR

#### L2TOR: Second Language Tutoring using Social Robots

Second Language Tutoring using Social Robots (3.043M EUR total budget, 544,013 EUR to Plymouth University) project. H2020 project, coordinated by Tony Belpaeme. Other partners University of Tilburg, Bielefeld University, Utrecht University, Koc University, Aldebaran Robotics and QBMT. The L2TOR studies how robots can be used to tutor a second language to young children. L2TOR capitalises on research that shows how social robots have marked benefits over screen-based tutoring technologies.

### [](#babel)BABEL

#### EPSRC Project BABEL: Bio-Inspired Architecture for Brain Embodied Language​.

BAEL is a new EPSRC project on the computational neuroscience modelling of language and action learning in the humanoid robot iCub, and its implementation in the neuromorphic systems SpiNNAker. It integrates cognitive neuroscience, brain imaging, neuro-computational modelling, and neurorobotic experiments in advancing our understanding of the neuroscience mechanisms supporting language learning.​ ​This project will lead to the design of neuromorphic systems for cognitive and language processing suitable for a wide range of interactive system applications (e.g. autonomous service robots, smart devices, speech interfaces, intelligent transport vehicles).

This project was funded by EPSRC EP/J004561/1 and lasted from August 2012 to March 2017. [http://www.babel-project.org/](http://www.babel-project.org/)

### [](#robotcwe)Robot@CWE

#### European Specific Targeted Research Project ROBOT@CWE: Advanced robotic systems in future collaborative working environments.

The main objective of this project was to research and demonstrate integrative concepts of advanced robotic systems, to be seen as collaborative agents, in various environments working together with humans. We integrated collaborative robotic systems as active agents operated through various control paradigms within working environment clusters. ROBOT@CWE designed suitable architectures and technologies to achieve this goal. A major aspect of the project was human-centred design, especially the assessment of usability, social acceptance, user experience, and societal impact of humanoid robots.

This STREP project was funded by FP6-2005-IST-5 Collaborative Working Environments and lasted from November 2006 to October 2009. [https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/80174_en.html](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/80174_en.html)
