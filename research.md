#### European Specific Targeted Research Project ROBOT@CWE: Advanced robotic systems in future collaborative working environments.

The main objective of this project was to research and demonstrate integrative concepts of advanced robotic systems, to be seen as collaborative agents, in various environments working together with humans. We integrated collaborative robotic systems as active agents operated through various control paradigms within working environment clusters. ROBOT@CWE designed suitable architectures and technologies to achieve this goal. A major aspect of the project was human-centred design, especially the assessment of usability, social acceptance, user experience, and societal impact of humanoid robots.

This STREP project was funded by FP6-2005-IST-5 Collaborative Working Environments and lasted from November 2006 to October 2009. [https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/80174_en.html](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/80174_en.html)
