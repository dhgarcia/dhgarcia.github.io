# [](#about-me)About me

_I am Dr. Daniel Hernández García, I am a researcher in Robotics, Cognitive Sciences and Human-Robot Interaction from Spain._

_I hold a PhD in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Automation from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain). My thesis work focused on learning, representation and generation of robot skill knowledge for humanoid robots reproduction._

_Currently I'm a postdoctoral research fellow in Human-Robot Interaction at the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems in Plymouth University (United Kingdom). My current research focuses on Human-Robot Interaction in social robots for education and therapy._

_I was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1983._

<!-- In 2007 I graduated in Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela. -->

<!-- In October 2010, I have been awarded the qualification of Master in Robotics and Automation by the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. -->

<!--
As a researcher, I have focused on Human-Robot Interaction, Machine Learning Algorithms and Cognitive Systems, taking part in a number of both, national and European projects.
I worked in the control of Humanoid Robots, principally with the fujitsu HOAP-3 robot platform. I also work in the development of Human-Robot Interfaces to interact with the robot and the implementation of Human-Robot Interaction and Computer Vision algorithms.

I am interested in topics of Human-Robot Interaction, Human-Robot Collaboration and Machine Learning Algorithms, Learning from Demonstration, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Systems and Data Analysis. -->
