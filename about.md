# [](#about-me)About me

_I am **Dr. Daniel Hernández García**, I am a researcher in Robotics, Cognitive Sciences and Human-Robot Interaction from Spain. I hold a **PhD in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Automation** from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (Spain). My thesis work focused on learning, representation and generation of robot skill knowledge for humanoid robots reproduction._

_Currently, I live in Plymouth (United Kingdom) where I'm a **postdoctoral research fellow in Human-Robot Interaction** at the [Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/robotics-neural-systems). My current research focuses on Human-Robot Interaction and Deep Learning in social robots for education and therapy; developing Robot-Enhanced Therapy (RET) and child-friendly tutor robots for second language learning in the scope of the DREAM and L2TOR projects._

_In 1983 I was born in Caracas, Venezuela, a rosy cheek beautiful baby boy. My father is from Venezuela, and my mother is from Asturias in Spain. I have two brothers, one older and one younger. I attended Colegio Santo Tomás de Aquino,  through all of my formative years, where I got very good grades, I was semifinalist and finalist at Mathematics and Physics Olympics at some year, I play football and baseball, and once I fractured my left humerus (not really sports related). In 2001 I started my studies at Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela, from where I graduated in 2007 as an **Electronic Engineer**, and was a member of the Electronics Students Center. Between September 2005 until March 2006 I was an Undergraduate Teacher Assistant, my first pay job, for Computer Architectures I (Arquitectura del Computador I) and Computer Architectures II (Arquitectura del Computador II) in the Electronics and Circuits Department. In 2006, as part of my engineering course and end-of-degree project, I was a visiting researcher at the Instituto de Automatica Industrial (now called [Centro de Automática y Robótica](https://www.car.upm-csic.es/)) under the supervision of Dr. Manuel Armada; in collaboration with Dr. Gerardo Fernandez (as supervisor from my university) and the [Grupo de Investigación y Desarrollo en Mecatrónica](http://www.labc.usb.ve/mecatronica/quienes_somos.html). Here I took my first steps into robotics research. My work consisted on designing and implementing a Human-­Robot Interface for controlling the REST Robot, a climbing hexapod robot intended for welding tasks in ferromagnetic walls._

_In 2007 I graduated in Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela. After graduation I worked in 2007-2008 for EINPHOS and the Sartenejas Technology Park, as a R&D engineer for two projects; the Automatization of the Theatrical Rigging System of the Ríos Reyna Hall at The Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex; and researching viability of implementing traffic engineering and intelligent transport systems (ITS) in the area surrounding the university campus. By 2008 the process of erosion and destruction of Venezuela carried out by Chavez regime, later continued by Maduro, have already reach a point where a future in my native country was no longer a viable option and I embarked on a quest to build an academic career by pursuing a Master and PhD degrees in Europe._

_I was awarded a FPI ("Formación Profesional Investigador") grant from the Spanish Government, for the formation of researchers and doctoral candidates. My grant was assigned to project DPI2007-60311 COOPERACION ACTIVA DE ROBOTS HUMANOIDES Y HUMANOS EN ENTORNOS COLABORATIVOS DE TRABAJO (Active Cooperation of humanoid robots and humans in collaborative working environments) under the supervision of Dr. Carlos Balaguer. From October 2008 I became a part of the [RoboticsLab](http://roboticslab.uc3m.es/roboticslab/) at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. In October 2010, I was awarded the qualification of Master in Robotics and Automation by the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid._

_Between March and July 2010 I did a secondment at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, under the supervision of Dr. Aude Billard. At the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA) I worked on the development of Learning From Demonstration (LfD) algorithms._

_I finished my PhD in October 2014._

_I speak Spanish and English. I did A1 level course for German but can't remember much. I have learned and pick up in time a bit of French (but can't speak or understand much really) and Italian (know only the bad words :wink:). And I've been taught to say "arigato gozaimashita" in Japanese_
