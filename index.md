# [](#welcome)Welcome


I am **Dr. Daniel Hernández García**, I am a researcher in Robotics, Cognitive Sciences, Human-Robot Interactions, Robots for Therapy and Care and Social Robots.

Since 2020 I'm a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at the Interaction Lab, School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Heriot-Watt University.

Previously I've been a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at the [COGNITIVE ROBOTICS LAB](https://corolab.github.io/) in the Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester (United Kingdom) and a **Postdoct** at the Centre for Robotics and Neural Systems in Plymouth University (United Kingdom). I received my MSc. degree in Robotics and Automation and my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Automation from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.

# [](#research)Research

Currently, I work in the [SPRING](research#spring) EU project, my research is focused on developing socially aware robots with the capacity for cognitive interactions, with a particular emphasis into bringing socially assistive robots into gerontological healthcare. Using data-driven and reinforcement learning approaches for Human-Robot Interaction, the ultimate goal is to have a robot that is able to understand various individual and group social situations, take appropriate decisions, and engage in face-to-face multi-modal dialogue with multiple people.


<!-- My current research is carried out under the scope of the H2020 EU project [MoveCare](research#movecare) focus on machine learning for HRI and elderly care. -->

<!-- [DREAM](research#dream) and [L2TOR](research#l2tor). I am focused on Human-Robot Interaction in social robots for education and therapy; developing Robot-Enhanced Therapy (RET) and child-friendly tutor robots for second language learning. -->
