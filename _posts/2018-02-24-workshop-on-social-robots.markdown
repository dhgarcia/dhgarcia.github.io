I'm co-organizing a workshop at the upcoming [ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2018)](http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2018/schedule/) this 5th of March in Chicago, IL. Join us for a full-day workshop on [Social Robots in Therapy: focusing on autonomy and ethical challenges (SREC18)](https://sites.google.com/view/srec18/home) where we aim at understanding how increasing the autonomy of robots might affect therapies as well as the design and ethical challenges of health-care robots.

The workshop is aim to reflect on existing Robot-Assisted-Therapy robots and ongoing research on HRI in the domestic and the care facility contexts. We want to gather, compare, and combine knowledge gained in various HRI projects with robots in therapy in the US, Europe, and Asia. This should lead to a broader understanding of how increasing the degree of autonomy of the robots might affect therapies as well as the design and ethical challenges of health-care robots. With this workshop we want to explore which degree of autonomy might help to improve health-care interventions and how we can overcome the ethical challenges inherent to it.

We will have an interesting program featuring 12 participants interventions and 4 invited speakers: Adriana Tapus, Jamy Li, Maartje de Graaf and Jenay Beer. Check out the program on our [website](https://sites.google.com/view/srec18/program/schedule).
