I'm co-organizing a workshop at the upcoming [ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI 2018)](http://humanrobotinteraction.org/2018/schedule/) this 5th of March in Chicago, IL. Join us for a full-day workshop on [Social Robots in Therapy](https://sites.google.com/view/srec18/home) where we aim at understanding how increasing the autonomy of robots might affect therapies as well as the design and ethical challenges of health-care robots.
